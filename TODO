  ☐ Add order index to tasks, Ex: 0, 1, 2, 3
  ☐ Make tasks draggable and also to different tabs
  ☐ Multiple tabs for different categories : | General | School | Work | Etc |
  ☐ If due date is close to today's date, it should change color (Yellow, Red, etc..)
  ☐ Make performance better
    ☐ Use indexing for DB
    ☐ Make it so it only saves to the DB after a few seconds of no interaction from the user
  ☐ Use local storage and save periodically instead of saving each time
  ☐ Use combination of client sessions + serverside
  ☐ Maybe use modal windows for error messages such as if you try to add a new task without a name
  ☐ Add a task limit through serverside
  ☐ Add hacker / bot protection
  ☐ Use server side rendering with axios
  ☐ Customizable changing the color
  ☐ Use Moment JS
IDEAS:
  ☐ Maybe make it so that you can publicize things you have done, to motivate others and show off? Social aspect
  ☐ A chat room or maybe a place people can post stuff to motivate others
  ☐ Maybe you can match with people that completed similiar tasks
